			Page 1: “Princess Mia”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

As the first rays of dawn crept through the heavy velvet curtains, Mia Dè Li Averj stirred in her silk-covered bed. At fifteen, the Crown Princess of the Holy Dè Li Averj Empire was already accustomed to the luxuries and responsibilities her title bestowed upon her. Her long, golden hair fanned out on the pillows, a stark contrast to the dark blue satin sheets. With a languid stretch, she reached up and rang the delicate silver bell hanging from the bedpost, its sound echoing through the vast chambers.


Almost immediately, the door creaked open, and a group of maids hurried in, their faces pale with fear and anticipation. Mia sat up, her dark blue eyes scanning them with a mixture of boredom and disdain.


“Hurry up, I don’t have all day,” she snapped, her voice icy and imperious.


The maids rushed forward, their hands trembling as they worked to dress her. One maid, a young girl named Eliza, was particularly nervous. Her hands shook so much that she accidentally tied Mia’s waist too tight.


“Ouch! You incompetent fool!” Mia hissed, her face contorting with rage. Without warning, she slapped Eliza hard across the face, the sound reverberating in the room. As Eliza staggered back, Mia kicked her in the stomach, causing her to collapse to the floor, gasping for breath.


“You’re fired!” Mia shouted, pointing towards the door. “Get out of my sight!”


Eliza scrambled to her feet and ran out, tears streaming down her face. The remaining maids exchanged terrified glances but continued their work, their hands trembling even more. They knew better than to make another mistake. After what seemed like an eternity, they finally finished dressing her in an elegant, intricately embroidered gown.


Satisfied with her appearance, Mia dismissed them with a wave of her hand and strutted out of her chambers, heading towards the grand dining room. As she entered, the opulence of the room didn’t faze her; she had seen it every day of her life. The long table was laden with a sumptuous breakfast spread, enough to feed a small army.


Her father, Emperor Benjamin Dè Li Averj, a tall man with striking blonde hair and piercing black eyes, sat at the head of the table. Next to him was her step-mother, Empress Ashley Dè Li Averj, a woman of serene beauty with brown hair and light blue eyes. Her siblings were already seated: Alexander Dè Li Averj, the thirteen-year-old prince with brown hair and black eyes, and Princess Madison Dè Li Averj, her twelve-year-old sister with a mix of brown and blonde hair and light blue eyes. Sitting at the far end was Princess Cornelia Dè Li Averj, the half-sister Mia despised, her light green eyes downcast, reflecting her meek demeanor.


“Good morning, Father, Step-Mother,” Mia greeted, her tone sweet and respectful as she acknowledged her parents and siblings with a nod. But her eyes passed over Cornelia as if she were invisible.


Cornelia lowered her head further, trying to make herself as small as possible. Mia took her seat, her back straight, and began to select her breakfast from the array of dishes, her demeanor transforming from a spoiled brat to a composed princess, the fire of her earlier anger still smoldering beneath the surface.



Page 2: “The Library”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

The clinking of silverware against porcelain filled the grand dining room as the Dè Li Averj family began their breakfast. Mia ate with the grace and precision expected of a crown princess, her every movement a display of practiced elegance. Across the table, Cornelia took a hesitant bite of her food, her eyes flicking nervously towards Mia.


It didn’t take long for Mia to notice. She set down her fork and leaned forward, a malicious glint in her dark blue eyes.


“Cornelia,” Mia began sweetly, a sharp contrast to her intentions, “do you even know how to hold a fork properly? It’s embarrassing to watch you struggle with basic etiquette.”


Cornelia’s cheeks flushed a deep crimson. She mumbled an apology, her hands shaking as she tried to correct her grip. The rest of the family continued their meal in uncomfortable silence, their eyes focused on their plates, refusing to meet Mia’s gaze or come to Cornelia’s defense.


“For heaven’s sake, you look like a commoner trying to imitate a lady,” Mia continued, her voice dripping with contempt. “It’s no wonder you can’t keep up. You’ll never fit in here.”


Cornelia’s eyes filled with tears, but she didn’t dare look up. The minutes dragged on, each second of Mia’s relentless criticism stretching into an agonizing eternity. The other family members remained silent, their faces impassive, as if they were unaware of the cruelty unfolding before them.


An hour passed like this, with Mia’s taunts growing harsher and more pointed, the atmosphere growing increasingly oppressive. Finally, Alexander could bear it no longer. He set his fork down with a deliberate clatter and looked directly at Mia, his black eyes flashing with anger.


“Enough, Mia,” he said sharply. “You’ve made your point. There’s no need to be so cruel.”


Mia’s expression hardened, a flicker of rage crossing her face. But she held it in, maintaining her composed facade. “I was merely trying to help her improve,” she replied coolly. “If Cornelia can’t handle a little criticism, she’ll never survive in court.”


Alexander’s jaw tightened, but he said nothing more, his eyes locked with Mia’s in a silent battle of wills. Eventually, the meal concluded, and the family began to disperse.


Mia rose from her seat and glided out of the dining room, her anger simmering beneath her calm exterior. She made her way to the Royal Library, a sanctuary of knowledge and quiet within the palace’s bustling corridors. The vast room was lined with towering shelves filled with ancient tomes and manuscripts, the air heavy with the scent of old parchment.


She found Alexander near a window, a book in his hand, his expression troubled.

“Alexander,” Mia called softly, her tone surprisingly gentle. He looked up, his expression guarded. “Would you care to join me for tea in my room? I have something I’d like to discuss.”


Alexander hesitated, then nodded. “Very well, Mia. I’ll join you shortly.” Mia smiled, a small, calculated smile, and turned to leave the library, her mind already plotting her next move.

Page 3: “Contract of Servitude”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

Mia led Alexander into her opulent chambers, the room bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun streaming through the tall, arched windows. The air was thick with the scent of roses from the garden below. Mia gestured for Alexander to sit at a small, elegantly set table in the center of the room. A porcelain tea set awaited them, steam curling lazily from the teapot.

“Please, have a seat,” Mia said, her voice unnaturally sweet.

Alexander complied, his eyes wary. Mia poured the tea, her movements graceful and deliberate, before handing him a delicate china cup. He accepted it, his gaze never leaving her face, and took a sip.

Mia watched him intently, her dark blue eyes glinting with malice. After a few moments, she rose from her seat and began to pace around the table, her presence looming over him.

“I laced your tea with Mind Lily flower extract,” she said calmly. “It will make you utterly submissive for the next ten minutes.”

Alexander’s eyes widened in shock, but his body remained still, the effects of the drug taking hold. Mia pulled a rolled parchment from a drawer and spread it out on the table in front of him. The contract was written in elaborate, archaic script, the words shimmering faintly with magical energy.

“This contract,” Mia began, her voice cold and authoritative, “binds you to my service. You will never betray my orders, and if you do, you will be compelled to kill Father. You will never harm yourself or me, in any manner, whether directly or indirectly. Should you attempt to break these terms, the contract will burst your heart.”

With a swift motion, Mia took out a small, silver needle and pricked her finger. She pressed her bleeding fingertip to the lower left side of the contract, and the parchment glowed with a mystical light. Her bloody fingerprint transformed into an unerasable, dark red ink, sealing her part of the agreement.

“Now, it’s your turn,” Mia commanded, holding the needle out to Alexander.

Under the influence of the Mind Lily, Alexander had no choice but to comply. He took the needle, pricked his finger, and pressed it to the designated spot on the contract. The document glowed again, then slowly burned to ash, the remnants dissipating into the air.

“We have signed a Magic Contract of servitude,” Mia explained, her tone triumphant. “The terms are simple: absolute obedience to me. Only I can break this contract. If you try, it will kill you.”

She let out a chilling, triumphant laugh, her eyes sparkling with cruelty. “This is your punishment for daring to speak against me when I was disciplining Cornelia. You will learn your place, Alexander.”

Alexander’s face remained impassive, but inside, he was seething with a mixture of rage and helplessness. Mia, satisfied with her victory, took her seat again, her demeanor shifting back to that of the composed princess.

“Now, dear brother,” she said, her voice laced with mock affection, “would you care for more tea?”


Page 4: “Alliances”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

Mia dismissed Alexander with a wave of her hand, watching as he exited her chambers with a dazed expression. Content with her work, she made her way to the palace garden, her steps light and graceful. The garden was a vibrant explosion of color, meticulously tended to by her younger sister, Madison.

Madison was crouched by a bed of flowers, her hands gently pruning the delicate blooms. As Mia approached, Madison looked up, her light blue eyes brightening at the sight of her sister.

“Mia!” Madison greeted cheerfully, her face glowing with pride. “Look at the flowers! I’ve been working so hard to make them perfect.”

Mia's expression softened, and she smiled with genuine affection. “Oh, Madison, they’re absolutely wonderful,” she said, her voice warm and approving. “You’ve done such a beautiful job. I’ve always admired your talent with the flowers.”

Madison beamed, clearly pleased with the praise. Mia reached out and patted her sister on the head, a rare gesture of tenderness. “Keep up the good work. You’re always so good at these things.”

As Mia turned to leave, she paused to admire a cluster of blue flowers. Her lips curved into a mischievous smile as she whispered, “I just love those Mind Lily’s.”

Leaving the garden behind, Mia made her way to the royal carriage waiting at the castle’s entrance. As she stepped inside, the carriage’s plush interior enveloped her in comfort. The carriage rumbled through the streets of Dè Li Averj City, the familiar cityscape unfolding outside the windows.

Upon reaching the central market, the sight of the royal carriage drew immediate attention. The moment people caught sight of Mia, their faces paled with fear. They fell to their knees and bowed deeply, a customary sign of respect for the royalty. Mia watched with a satisfied smirk as the entire market seemed to come to a standstill in her presence.

The carriage came to a halt outside a charming bakery, its quaint exterior belying the significance of the meeting about to take place. Mia stepped out, her regal demeanor commanding attention and respect. Inside the bakery, she was greeted by the Crown Prince Renard Varek of the Imperial Varek Dynasty, who was waiting with his father, King Ashford Varek.

Renard, a tall and imposing figure with a sharp gaze, offered a polite but reserved smile as Mia approached. “Mia,” he said, his tone a blend of formality and friendliness. “It’s good to see you.”

Mia nodded, her smile never faltering. “Renard, it’s a pleasure. Shall we discuss the matter over some refreshments?”

They settled into a quiet corner of the bakery, the aroma of freshly baked goods mingling with the tension in the air. As they began their discussion, Renard’s demeanor shifted from friendly to serious.

“I’ve heard quite a lot about you, Mia,” Renard began, his eyes scrutinizing her carefully. “Your reputation precedes you.”

Mia’s smile faltered slightly but quickly returned to its usual cold composure. “I’m aware,” she replied smoothly. “And?”

Renard leaned forward, his tone firm but not unkind. “I understand that your actions have earned you a certain notoriety. It’s something that concerns me, especially with the proposed alliance between our families.”

Mia’s eyes narrowed slightly, but she remained composed. “And what of it?”

Renard’s gaze was steady. “While I’m here to negotiate an alliance, I must admit that your reputation casts a shadow over these discussions. It’s difficult to ignore the impact it might have on our negotiations and future cooperation.”

Mia’s smile remained, though it was tinged with irritation. “I assure you, Renard, that my personal reputation won’t affect the terms of our alliance. What matters is the strength and benefits of our combined power.”

Renard’s expression softened slightly. “Of course, Mia. I’ll remain friendly and open to our discussions. But I hope you understand my concerns.”

Mia nodded, her gaze fixed on Renard with a mixture of challenge and agreement. “I do. Let’s proceed with the negotiations then.”

The conversation continued, the delicate balance of diplomacy and personal dynamics shaping the dialogue.


Page 5: “Innocence”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

As Mia and Renard continued their discussion, the door to the bakery opened, and Emperor Benjamin Dè Li Averj strode in, his presence commanding immediate respect. His tall figure and stern demeanor brought a palpable shift to the atmosphere. He greeted Renard and King Ashford with a nod, then turned his attention to Mia.

“Father,” Mia said with a nod of her own, her voice perfectly composed. “I was just concluding our discussion with Crown Prince Renard and King Ashford.”

Emperor Benjamin took his place at the table, his gaze sharp and assessing. “I trust the discussions have been productive?”

Renard nodded. “Indeed, Your Majesty. We were just finalizing the terms of the alliance.”

The meeting continued with renewed focus. Hours passed as the details of the alliance were hammered out, both sides eager to ensure that the agreement was advantageous and comprehensive. The discussion was marked by careful negotiation and strategic concessions, reflecting the high stakes of the alliance between the Holy Dè Li Averj Empire and the Imperial Varek Dynasty.

Finally, with the final details settled and mutual agreements reached, the alliance was officially formed. The atmosphere was one of cautious optimism, and formalities were observed as both parties signed the necessary documents to seal their commitment.

As the meeting drew to a close, King Ashford, looking pleased but curious, turned to Mia with a friendly smile. “Mia, the last time we met, you mentioned your cousin Arnold. How is he doing?”

Mia’s face remained a mask of serene composure, though a glint of something cold flickered in her dark blue eyes. “Arnold?” she said, her voice smooth and indifferent. “He’s not well, I’m afraid. He’s locked away in the dungeon.”

King Ashford’s brows knitted together in concern. “Locked away? What happened?”

Mia’s smile was icy, her tone devoid of warmth. “Arnold took something from me that he had no right to—my purity. He did so by force. Given his actions, his confinement is a fitting consequence.”

The room fell silent, the gravity of Mia’s words hanging heavily in the air. Renard’s expression shifted to one of surprise and concern, while Emperor Benjamin’s face remained inscrutable, though a flicker of disapproval crossed his features.

King Ashford cleared his throat, trying to restore the conversation to a more neutral ground. “Well, it seems that the alliance is well-secured. I look forward to our continued cooperation.”

Mia nodded, her gaze steady. “As do I, Your Majesty. Thank you for your understanding.”

With the formalities concluded, the group began to disperse. Mia exchanged polite farewells with Renard and King Ashford, her demeanor once again shifting to her usual, composed self. As the two royal families prepared to depart, the weight of the day’s events seemed to settle into a complex tapestry of diplomacy, personal grievances, and strategic alliances.
















Page 6: “That Night”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

The night that forever changed Mia Dè Li Averj began like any other in the grand Royal Dè Li Averj Palace. It was five years ago, and fifteen-year-old Mia had been a different person—soft, caring, and wholly devoted to the well-being of her family and her kingdom. Her days were filled with genuine smiles, her evenings with heartfelt laughter shared with her siblings. The palace was a place of warmth and love, and Mia had been its radiant center.


That night, the palace was quieter than usual. The golden light of dusk had given way to the cold embrace of darkness, and the only sounds were the soft rustle of silk curtains and the occasional whisper of the night wind. Mia had retired to her chambers early, eager for a good night’s rest.


Arnold Dè Li Averj, her cousin, was visiting from a distant province. He had always been a source of annoyance for Mia, but she had tried to maintain a semblance of family unity, even when he was less than kind. The visit had been tolerable until that night, when everything changed.


She was asleep in her bed, wrapped in the comfort of her heavy blankets. The serenity of her room, adorned with delicate tapestries and plush furnishings, was suddenly shattered. The door creaked open with a barely audible sound, and Arnold slipped into her chamber, his movements stealthy and deliberate.


Mia was woken abruptly by the presence of someone in her room. Disoriented, she turned her head to find Arnold standing beside her bed. His eyes were not the warm, friendly eyes of family, but cold and calculating. Before she could react, he was on her, overpowering her with an aggression she had never encountered. The struggle was brief and devastating; though she begged him to stop, she was powerless against his force.


The pain and horror of that night were beyond anything Mia had ever known. When it was over, she lay there in shock, her mind racing, trying to make sense of what had just happened. The gentle, caring princess who had once embraced her role with kindness and compassion was gone, replaced by a deep and consuming anger.


In the aftermath, Mia’s world turned dark. She felt betrayed by her own family, her trust shattered. The palace that had once been a sanctuary of warmth now felt like a prison. The pain transformed into a bitter resolve, and the gentle princess became a hardened and manipulative figure, driven by a desire for control and revenge.


Arnold was locked away in the dungeon, his fate sealed by Mia’s decree. The betrayal had marked a turning point, the moment when Mia’s heart hardened and her compassion was replaced by a steely resolve to never be vulnerable again. She withdrew into herself, her relationships with her siblings and her parents growing increasingly strained. The once loving and nurturing princess became a ruler feared and respected for her cruelty.


As she navigated her new reality, Mia’s reputation as a villain began to take shape. The actions of that night had forged her into a figure of power and fear, the caring princess of the past fading into the shadows of a woman driven by her own dark desires and unyielding control.


In the solitude of her chambers, Mia often found herself reflecting on that fateful night where her virginity was stolen. She had, and still has nightmares about it every night reliving it over and over. It was a painful memory, but also a constant reminder of the strength she had found in her own darkness.



Page 7: “War”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”


The sun had barely risen over the horizon when urgent knocks resounded through the corridors of the Royal Dè Li Averj Palace. Emperor Benjamin Dè Li Averj, tall and formidable, with his striking blonde hair and piercing black eyes, sat in his study, a frown deepening the lines on his face. The messenger, a young soldier, entered with a bowed head, his voice trembling as he relayed the grave news.


"The Nicon Kingdom has declared war on the Holy Dè Li Averj Empire, Your Majesty. Their forces are amassing on our borders."


Benjamin’s face darkened, and with a curt nod, he dismissed the messenger. Immediately, he summoned the War Council. This was no ordinary gathering; the head of the army, the empire’s finance manager, a representative of the populace, the Grand Duke, and all the royals were to convene in the grand council chamber. Each member had a vote, their collective decision crucial to the empire's future.


Within the hour, the grand council chamber filled with the murmur of voices and the rustle of opulent robes. Emperor Benjamin took his seat at the head of the table, his gaze sweeping over the assembled council. Empress Ashley, her serene beauty masking her inner turmoil, sat beside him. Alexander and Madison were present, their faces reflecting varying degrees of concern. Mia, with her golden hair and dark blue eyes, sat poised and composed, her mind already calculating her next move.


The head of the army, General Armand, a grizzled veteran with a commanding presence, spoke first. "Your Majesty, the Nicon forces are numerous and well-equipped. A defensive strategy might be prudent to minimize our losses while we muster additional troops."


The finance manager, Lord Sinclair, a thin man with a sharp intellect, nodded in agreement. "Our treasury is sufficient to fund a prolonged defense, but a drawn-out war could strain our resources. We must consider the economic impact."


Next, Lady Elara, the representative of the populace, voiced the concerns of the common people. "The citizens are fearful, Your Majesty. They support a defensive approach, hoping to avoid the horrors of war reaching their homes."


The Grand Duke, a man of immense influence, stroked his beard thoughtfully. "A defensive stance may seem wise, but it could embolden our enemies. We should consider a show of strength to deter further aggression."


Finally, it was Mia's turn. She rose gracefully, her presence commanding attention. "Father, esteemed council members," she began, her voice cold and resolute. "A defensive strategy may seem prudent, but it is fraught with risks. We cannot allow the Nicon Kingdom to think us weak. I propose a preemptive strike."


Gasps and murmurs filled the room, but Mia continued undeterred. "Our forces are well-trained and loyal. We strike swiftly and decisively, crippling their ability to wage war. This empire has always thrived on strength and dominance. We must not falter now."


Her words hung in the air, and for a moment, silence reigned. Emperor Benjamin looked at each member of the council, his expression unreadable. "We shall put this to a vote," he declared. "Each member shall cast their vote for either a defensive strategy or a preemptive strike."


One by one, the council members cast their votes. General Armand, Lord Sinclair, and Lady Elara voted for a defensive strategy. The Grand Duke, Empress Ashley, and Madison, influenced by Mia’s conviction, voted for a preemptive strike. The deciding vote came down to Alexander.


Mia’s eyes locked onto Alexander’s, her gaze intense and unyielding. Bound by the contract Mia had forced upon him, Alexander's will was not his own. He hesitated, his inner conflict evident, but finally spoke, his voice steady yet hollow. "I vote for a preemptive strike."


With the votes tallied, the decision was made. Emperor Benjamin, his face a mask of grim determination, nodded. "Very well. We shall prepare for a preemptive strike."


Mia’s lips curved into a triumphant smile. She had leveraged her power over Alexander to stand as the most influential council member, guiding the empire toward a path of war. The council dispersed, each member moving to fulfill their duties, the weight of the impending conflict heavy in the air.


As Mia left the chamber, her thoughts were already on the next steps. She relished the power she held, the control she exerted over the empire and her family. War was coming, and with it, an opportunity for Mia Dè Li Averj to solidify her dominance over all who dared to challenge her.


Page 8: “Shadows of Power”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

Night had settled over the Royal Dè Li Averj Palace, its grandeur cloaked in shadows. Mia Dè Li Averj moved with practiced stealth through the dimly lit corridors, her elegant gown replaced by a plain, hooded cloak that concealed her identity. She had dismissed her royal guards with a stern command, leveraging her authority and the fear she inspired to ensure no one would dare follow her.


Slipping through a hidden passage known only to the royal family, Mia emerged into the moonlit gardens. She moved quickly, her steps silent as she navigated the familiar paths. At the garden’s edge, a simple carriage awaited, driven by a trusted servant who had been sworn to secrecy. Without a word, Mia climbed inside, pulling the hood lower over her face.


The journey to the Nicon Kingdom was swift, the carriage cutting through the night like a phantom. Mia’s mind was sharp, her thoughts focused on the meeting ahead. As they crossed the border into Nicon territory, she felt a surge of anticipation. This was the culmination of months of careful planning and secret communications.


The carriage halted before a nondescript tavern on the outskirts of the Nicon capital. Mia disembarked, her demeanor unassuming as she entered the tavern. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of ale and smoke, the low murmur of conversations filling the room. Mia spotted King Edric of the Nicon Kingdom at a corner table, his rugged features partially hidden by the dim light.


“Mia,” Edric greeted with a nod, his voice low and cordial. “You’ve made it.”


She slipped into the seat opposite him, her eyes scanning the room to ensure they were not overheard. “Indeed, Edric. I trust you’ve kept our meeting confidential?”


Edric chuckled, a knowing glint in his eyes. “As always, Princess. Now, shall we get down to business?”


They ordered drinks, the tavern keeper bringing them two goblets of dark wine. As they sipped, their conversation remained casual, the easy banter of old friends. But beneath the surface, the tension was palpable, each word laden with hidden meanings and unspoken plans.


“So, how goes the war preparations?” Edric asked, swirling his wine thoughtfully.


Mia’s eyes glinted with malice. “The Council is as divided as ever, but they have agreed to mobilize our forces. The Emperor is too focused on the immediate threat to notice what’s happening right under his nose.”


Edric leaned in, his expression serious. “And your plan to... expedite his departure?”


A cold smile curved Mia’s lips. “It’s progressing smoothly. The war will provide the perfect cover. While the others are distracted, we will strike. By the time they realize what’s happened, I will be on the throne, and our alliance will be solidified.”


They raised their goblets in a silent toast, the dark wine reflecting the flickering candlelight. “To new beginnings,” Edric said, his voice filled with dark promise.


“To power,” Mia replied, her gaze unwavering.


After their drinks, Edric unfurled a large map on the table, detailing the island they called home. The map showed the four major territories: the Holy Dè Li Averj Empire in the top quarter, the Imperial Varek Dynasty in the left quarter, the Nicon Kingdom in the bottom quarter, and the Great Hann Empire in the right quarter. The central region, a disputed and perilous area known as the Wildlands, was marked by jagged lines and ominous symbols.


Mia traced a finger over the map, her mind calculating. “The Wildlands will be crucial. If we can secure a route through them, we can flank the Varek forces and take them by surprise. The Hann Empire will remain neutral as long as we maintain our trade agreements.”


Edric nodded, his eyes following her finger. “And the Dè Li Averj forces? How do you plan to ensure their loyalty?”


Mia’s smile was cold and calculating. “Fear is a powerful motivator. Those who resist will be dealt with swiftly. My father’s death will send a clear message: loyalty to me is the only option.”


They continued to pore over the map, their discussion punctuated by the occasional sip of wine. Strategies were formed, contingencies planned, and the fate of the island seemed to hang in the balance of their words.


As the night wore on, the alliance between Mia and Edric grew stronger, their shared ambition a dark bond that promised to reshape the world. In the flickering candlelight, they plotted and planned, their eyes gleaming with the fire of conquest.




Page 9: “Magic”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

Dawn was breaking as Mia Dè Li Averj’s carriage approached the palace gates, flanked by six of the Nicon Kingdom's elite soldiers. King Edric had chosen these men personally, their loyalty and skill beyond question. They were sworn to protect Mia, a testament to the burgeoning alliance between their kingdoms.


The soldiers remained vigilant as Mia disembarked, their presence a silent but powerful statement. Mia nodded to the captain of the guard, her eyes sharp despite the weariness she felt. "Ensure no one disturbs me," she ordered, her voice carrying the weight of authority.


"Yes, Princess," the captain replied, saluting crisply.


Mia retired to her chambers, the Nicon soldiers standing guard at her door. She undressed and slipped into her bed, her mind racing with the night's events. Sleep came swiftly, pulling her into a restless slumber filled with dreams of power and betrayal.


Hours later, the first rays of sunlight pierced through her window, waking her. Mia stretched, her mind quickly sharpening as she prepared for the day ahead. She dressed meticulously, choosing a gown that exuded both elegance and authority.


Stepping out of her chambers, Mia acknowledged the Nicon soldiers with a nod. They fell in step behind her, a silent but formidable entourage as she made her way to the dining room.


The room was already bustling with activity when she arrived. Emperor Benjamin Dè Li Averj sat at the head of the table, his regal presence commanding attention. Empress Ashley and Mia’s siblings, including Cornelia, were seated, engaged in light conversation.


Mia took her seat, her gaze briefly meeting her father’s before she focused on her meal. The food was sumptuous, a spread of fruits, pastries, and finely prepared meats. She ate with calculated grace, every movement precise.


After a few moments, Emperor Benjamin addressed her. "Firefly," he began, using her childhood nickname, "I have been thinking about your future."


Mia’s eyes flicked up to meet his, her expression serene. "Yes, Father?"


The Emperor's gaze was piercing. "I wish to see you married this season. It is time you solidify your position, especially once the war is over."


Mia forced a smile, her mind quickly adjusting to this new twist. "Of course, Father. I will do what is necessary for our family's honor."


Satisfied with her response, the Emperor nodded and returned to his meal. Mia's smile faded as she turned her attention to Cornelia, who sat quietly at the end of the table.


"Poor Cornelia," Mia said with mock pity. "With your half-blood status and that unfortunate face, I doubt you will ever find a husband."


Cornelia looked up, her expression calm but her eyes sharp. "Actually, Father," she said, addressing the Emperor, "I have something to share. I unlocked my magic recently."


The room fell silent as all eyes turned to Cornelia. The Emperor's interest was piqued. "Is that so? What type of magic, my dear?"


Cornelia smiled, a hint of triumph in her eyes. "Light magic, Father. I am the first of my siblings to unlock it."


Mia’s smirk vanished, her eyes narrowing as she regarded Cornelia with a mixture of surprise and anger. The room buzzed with low murmurs, the significance of Cornelia's revelation not lost on anyone present.


The Emperor's face lit up with pride. "Remarkable, Cornelia. This is wonderful news. We must begin your training immediately."


Mia clenched her teeth, struggling to maintain her composure. Cornelia’s calm demeanor and strategic revelation had temporarily shifted the balance of power at the table. For the moment, Mia was silent, her mind already plotting her next move.




Page 10: “Invaders”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

The dining room doors burst open, slamming against the walls with a thunderous crash. General Armand stormed in, his face a mask of urgency and panic. Before he could utter a word, the Nicon soldiers leapt to action, swiftly surrounding him and restraining his movements.


Mia raised a hand, her voice calm and commanding. "Release him."


The soldiers obeyed instantly, stepping back but remaining alert. Emperor Benjamin Dè Li Averj’s eyes narrowed as he looked from the general to the unfamiliar soldiers. "Who are these men, Mia?" he demanded.


Mia turned to her father, her expression composed. "They are my new personal guards, Father. I hired them to ensure my safety during these tumultuous times."


The Emperor's gaze lingered on the soldiers for a moment longer before shifting to General Armand. "What is the meaning of this interruption, General?"


Breathing heavily, the general straightened himself, his eyes wide with alarm. "Your Majesty, I bring grave news. The Nicon Kingdom’s army has taken the Wildlands and marched straight into the capital!"


A split second later, an explosion rocked the palace, the shockwave rattling the windows and sending vibrations through the floor. The royal family and their attendants rushed to the windows, looking out in horror. The streets below were chaos, Nicon knights clashing with the city guard, and the financial institute consumed by flames. Amidst the inferno, Lord Sinclair’s body lay motionless, a grim testament to the sudden violence.


Emperor Benjamin’s face twisted with rage and disbelief. He turned to the general, his voice a roar of command. "Mobilize the army immediately! We must reclaim our capital and drive these invaders out!"


General Armand saluted sharply and rushed out of the room, barking orders to the palace guards as he went. The room was a frenzy of activity, the royal family’s breakfast forgotten in the face of the immediate crisis.


Mia stepped back, her expression carefully neutral, though inside she was seething. The attack had come too soon, before she could fully cement her plans. But there was no time to dwell on it now; the game was in motion, and she had to adapt quickly.


The Emperor turned to Mia, his eyes filled with a mixture of fury and confusion. "These new guards of yours, make sure they are ready for battle. We will need every able hand."


Mia nodded, her mind already calculating the next steps. "Of course, Father. They are at your service."


As the palace prepared for war, Mia’s thoughts raced. The Nicon Kingdom’s betrayal had forced her hand, but she was not without options. Her position was precarious, but she still held cards yet to be played. And she would play them with all the cunning and ruthlessness at her disposal.




Page 11: “An Ambush”, Chapter 1: “Cruel at Heart”

The Emperor stood in the grand hall, facing Lady Evangeline, the representative of the populace. Her face was grim, reflecting the urgency of the situation. "Your Majesty, we must evacuate the citizens immediately. The city is no longer safe."


Emperor Benjamin nodded. "Begin the evacuation at once. Ensure every man, woman, and child reaches safety." He turned to his family, his expression softening. "The royal family will also evacuate with the citizens, except for Alexander. We need him here."


Mia stepped forward, her eyes pleading. "Father, I cannot leave you here to die. Let me stay by your side. We can face this together."


The Emperor hesitated, seeing the determination in her eyes. He sighed heavily. "Very well, Mia. You may stay. But stay close and follow my orders."


The army, led by the Emperor, General Armand, Prince Alexander, and Mia, along with the Nicon Kingdom’s guards, began their march into the besieged city. As they moved through the chaos, Mia suggested a plan.


"Father, we should split up to cover more ground. It will increase our chances of regaining control."


The Emperor, trusting his daughter's judgment, agreed. "Very well. Alexander, take half the knights and secure the eastern district. General, take the western. Mia and I will head towards the financial district with the remaining knights."


As they parted ways, Mia, her father, and twelve of his knights made their way through the labyrinthine streets. Once they were out of sight, Mia turned to the Nicon guards and waved her hand. "Now!"


The Nicon guards sprang into action, drawing their weapons and attacking the Emperor's knights. The clash of steel echoed through the narrow alley. The Emperor, still on his horse, looked at Mia with a mix of anger and fear. "Mia, what is the meaning of this betrayal?"


Mia gave him an evil grin, her eyes glinting with malice. "Did you really think I would let you live, Father? This is my time to rule.”


END OF CHAPTER ONE


Page 1: “A Battle Yet Over”, Chapter 2: “Empress to Be”


Mia watched her brother, Prince Alexander, and General Armand at the front lines, the clash of steel and the cries of battle all around them. The Nicon forces were relentless, pushing hard against the empire's defenders. Alexander fought fiercely, his eyes scanning the battlefield for any sign of their true enemy.


As the sun began to dip below the horizon, a chilling silence fell over the battleground. King Edric appeared on a ridge, mounted on a massive warhorse, his dark eyes surveying the chaos below. With a fluid motion, he dismounted and began walking towards them, each step deliberate, time seeming to slow around him.


Every knight who tried to intercept him was cut down with a single, precise slash of his sword. Blood sprayed through the air, and bodies fell like leaves in autumn.


"Prince Alexander, watch out!" General Armand shouted, but his warning came too late. Edric stood before them, his presence overpowering. He raised his hand and began to chant, his voice deep and resonant. "Ãĥðjwis Vetee."


A powerful gust of wind whipped around him, gathering strength until it became a roaring tornado. The force of the spell sent everyone—Prince Alexander, General Armand, and the empire's knights—flying through the air. They crashed into buildings, the impact knocking the wind out of them.


Alexander struggled to his feet, his vision blurry and body aching. He saw King Edric approaching, his hand glowing with magical energy, ready to unleash another devastating spell.


Just then, a voice rang out, clear and commanding. "Ãĥðjwis Carene!"


A blinding light exploded in front of Edric, causing him to stagger back, covering his eyes. Everyone turned to see Princess Cornelia standing tall, wielding a wand, her face set with determination.


Alexander's eyes widened in shock. Cornelia had been using her magic to protect them. "Cornelia..." he muttered, a mix of disbelief and admiration in his voice.


Cornelia didn't waver, her wand pointed directly at King Edric. "You will not harm my family," she declared, her voice strong and unwavering.


The knights around them, both loyal to the empire and those who had switched allegiances, took advantage of the distraction. They surged forward, creating a barrier between Edric and the Prince and Princess.


King Edric's eyes narrowed as he recovered from the spell. "So, the little half-blood has some fight in her," he sneered.


Cornelia stood firm, her wand still raised. "This isn't over," she said, her voice cold. "We'll defend our home to the last breath."


Alexander, still reeling from the impact, found himself filled with a new resolve. For now, they had to unite against a common enemy. He nodded to Cornelia, who had saved them, and to General Armand, who was rallying the troops.


"Form up!" General Armand shouted. "Protect the princess and the prince! Hold the line!"


Mia watched her brother and Cornelia from afar, the two siblings standing together for the first time in what felt like an eternity. "We fight together," Alexander said, his voice fierce. "For the empire."


The battle raged on, the royal family's unity a newfound strength against the invaders. Cornelia's light magic and King Edric's wind magic clashed, the air crackling with energy. The future of the empire hung in the balance, and for the first time, Alexander felt a flicker of hope amidst the chaos.



Page 2: “Magic Explained”, Chapter 2: “Empress to Be”

As the battle raged on and King Edric's powerful spells continued to wreak havoc, Alexander's mind wandered to the intricacies of the magical world they lived in. He knew that understanding magic was crucial to their survival and success in this war. Magic in their world was a complex and fascinating system, one that every child in the empire learned about from a young age.


Magic was fueled by Mana, an innate energy that everyone was born with. Each individual had a unique Mana capacity, determined at birth, and it couldn't be increased or decreased throughout their lifetime. Once a person's Mana was depleted, they would pass out from exhaustion. The only way to replenish Mana was through sleep, making rest vital for any magic user.


Spells were divided into three levels, each requiring a different amount of Mana:


Level 1 Spells: These required 10% of the user's total Mana. They were basic spells, often used for simple tasks or minor combat scenarios.

Level 2 Spells: These took up 80% of the user's total Mana. They were significantly more powerful and could affect multiple targets or create substantial effects.

Level 3 Spells: These consumed 90% of the user's total Mana and were the most powerful, often turning the tide of battles or causing large-scale destruction.

Magic was divided into different elements, each with its own unique spells and rarity.


Wind Magic (Rarity: 25%): 

Level 1: Ãĥðjwis Jena - "Sharp Breeze" - Cuts the target with a small breeze of wind

Level 2: Ãĥðjwis Hegrosh - "Whiplash" - Can affect 3 targets, makes the targets experience whiplash

Level 3: Ãĥðjwis Vetee - "Tornado" - Causes a Tornado


Earth Magic (Rarity: 25%): 

Level 1: Ãĥðjwis Fkej - "Rock Throw" - Shoots a small rock at a target

Level 2: Ãĥðjwis Iris - "Earth Wall" - Rips the earth from the ground to form a wall in front of the user, primarily used for defense

Level 3: Ãĥðjwis Owos - "Earthquake" - Causes an earthquake


Fire Magic (Rarity: 25%): 

Level 1: Ãĥðjwis Ahfh - "Fireball" - Shoots a ball of fire at a target

Level 2: Ãĥðjwis Jeks - "Wildfire" - Causes a huge burst of fire

Level 3: Ãĥðjwis Eya - "Hell Fire" - Starts an ever burning black flame which doesn't stop until it devours the target whole


Water Magic (Rarity: 25%): 

Level 1: Ãĥðjwis Qyeh - "Water Whip" - Whips the opponent with a bit of water

Level 2: Ãĥðjwis Eoqie - "Drain Liquid" - Can be used in daily activities to drain things such as a well,  but when used in battle it can drain all the liquid from a person's body, and is potentially lethal

Level 3: Ãĥðjwis Wpwj - "Tsunami" - Causes a Tsunami


Light Magic (Rarity: 1%): 

Level 1: Ãĥðjwis Carene - "Holy Light" - Used to light up dim areas, but can also be used to blind foes for a few seconds

Level 2: Ãĥðjwis Wyay - "Heal" - Can heal minor injuries, cannot stop death

Level 3: Ãĥðjwis Jajsn - "Cure Curse" - Can cure curses and break binding contracts, the more evil the curse the more people the user has to heal


Dark Magic (Rarity: 1%): 

Level 1: Ãĥðjwis Dwyt - "Ball of Darkness" - Shoots a ball of darkness at a target, when and if it hits the target it causes the hit area to instantly disintegrate

Level 2: Ãĥðjwis Qdef - "Curse" - Allows the user to put any existing curse on someone

Level 3: Ãĥðjwis Etve - "Curse Weaver" - Allows the user to create a new curse, the more evil the more sacrifices it costs


Alexander knew his Mana capacity well. It had been drilled into him during his training. In his mind he wondered how he could unlock his magic, and he knew he had to unlock it before it was too late.


King Edric's command of wind magic was formidable, as was evident in his use of the Level 3 spell, Tornado. The devastation it caused was a reminder of just how powerful high-level magic could be. Alexander’s mind raced, considering their options and the spells at their disposal.


As the wind died down and the dust settled, King Edric advanced, preparing another spell. But a sudden flash of light interrupted him. Cornelia, wielding her wand, had cast the Level 1 light magic spell, Holy Light, blinding Edric temporarily.


Alexander took advantage of the momentary reprieve. He needed to protect his family and the empire, even if it meant confronting one of the most dangerous men in the world. The battle was far from over, but understanding the limits and potentials of their magic gave them a fighting chance.


As Alexander, General Armand, and Cornelia stood together, they knew that the key to their survival and victory lay in their unity and strategic use of their magical abilities. The future of the empire depended on it.
